Cassia uses WebSSH2 by billchurch to initiate SSH sessions from AC to Gateways. WebSSH2 Is a web SSH Client which uses ssh2, socket.io, xterm.js, and express. 
A bare bones example of an HTML5 web-based terminal emulator and SSH client. It uses SSH2 as a client on a host to proxy a Websocket/Socket.io connection to a SSH2 server.

When a user is logged into AC it uses _ac:ssid_ cookie with Same Site Strict cookie. 
To Initiate SSH Web session with gateway users send GET request with mac and port number (reverse ssh).
